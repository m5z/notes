# Effective Python

## Pythonic Thinking
* Prefer `if a is not b` over `if not a is b`
* Don't check for empty containers by checking length
* Always use f-strings to format text
* DRY - write helper functions instead of squeezing stuff in one line
* Use `enumerate`
* Use `zip`
* `for/else` - don't use it
* Assignment expression - walrus operator `:=`
  * Use in `if`
  * Use for `do/while`
  * Emulate `switch` statements
